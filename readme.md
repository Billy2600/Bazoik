Go Bazoik!
The hallways are endless. The robots are infinite. Your choices are slim... It's shoot or die!
The metal-scraping voices of the cyber legion can be heard through the walls. Always a step behind you, always a step ahead. The only thing between oblivion and freedom is the High-Focus Teletronic Phase Zapper in your hands. Aim true, or your end will come all too soon!

Bazoik is a reimagining of the arcade classic, Berzerk. The visuals are modernized, the controls are as classic as can be, but there's surprises awaiting the player brave enough to dive in, and go Bazoik!
