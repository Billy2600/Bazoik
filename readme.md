## About

You're trapped.
Somewhere deep within these endless sterile corridors is you. The air smells of ozone from the lethal electrified walls. The stomps and threats from the endless robot legion thrum around you in all directions. Lost, confused, you're out of time, and full of rage. All that's left to your name is your wits, a polycarbon prisoner garb, and a handheld High-Focus Teletronic Phase Zapper. The clothes won't protect you from anything. But the Phase Zapper... That oughta take a few of them down.

Reexperience the arcade classic, Berzerk, in a new modernized form. Put together by three enthusiastic novices, we hope Bazoik will thrill and challenge you!

Bazoik is a tough-as-nails arcade style game; your objective is the surive as long as possible, while trying to attain the highest score possible! In order to move your character, simply press and hold any of the directional buttons (see default controls in the next section). To fire a bullet, simply hold the fire button while pressing any of the directional buttons. You cannot move while firing, so be sure to line up your shot! To pause the game, simply press the pause button, or the ESC key on your keyboard; the ESC key will work regardless of what pause is bound to. Your current score is shown in the top left of the game screen. Your current life count is shown in the bottom left corner; once you run out of lives, the game is over!
